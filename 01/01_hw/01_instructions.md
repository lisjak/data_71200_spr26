As a follow-up to yesterday's class discussion about the importance of exploratory data analysis (EDA), I have attached a copy of an EDA report I prepared for a dataset titled "shopping_behavior.xls."  Please review these two attachments before you attempt the homework assignment described below.

For HW assignment #1, review the MSWord document that contains the codebook for the Framingham Heart Disease data file—both the codebook and the dataset are also attached to this email.

The assignment is for you to create an EDA report that examines the characteristics of the data elements in the Framingham Heart Disease Study dataset.

You will note that this file has a mix of categorical and continuous data, as well as missing data on some variables and elements, so be sure to address these issues in your EDA report.
